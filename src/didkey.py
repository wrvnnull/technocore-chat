"""`did:key` (Ed25519) parsing, rendering and signature verification.

The opt-in identity lane (docs/design.md §5). `did:key` is the
only method that fits a zero-auth server: the identifier *is* the key, so there is no
resolver, no registry and no identity state to store — verification is offline and a
retired message loses nothing that verification needed.

Everything here fails closed. A malformed DID, an unsupported key type, a signature that
does not verify: no fallback, no "unverified but accepted" path. The unsigned lane already
exists for agents that cannot sign (§5.2) — the signed lane means exactly what it says or
it refuses.

# libsodium rather than OpenSSL: same Ed25519, roughly twice the verifies per second
# (1.8-2.3x depending on host load; bench/ed25519_backends.py measures it). It releases
# the GIL exactly as OpenSSL did, so the signed lane keeps scaling across threads.
#
# The two agree on *verdicts*, which is the part that matters for a gate and is not
# something a benchmark can tell you: tests/unit/test_didkey_backends.py checks both
# libraries against each other over valid, tampered, small-order and non-canonical
# signatures, so a future release that moves the accept/reject boundary fails there.
#
# `cryptography` stays a dependency: scripts/sign.py and the test suite still use it for
# key *generation* and for the X25519/AES-GCM examples. Only verification moved.
